    Rising global temperatures and CO2 levels have caused freshwater from increased rainfall and melting ice to dilute the salty sea water. Consequently the water lightens and is not able to sink (as before), slowing down the whole circulation. When the circulation slows down, less salty water flows northward, causing less density, resulting in less water sinking and lastly establishing this self-reinforcing system. A major contributor to freshwater increase is the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has been melting during the past two decades.
