  # Coral Reef Die-Off

  This is arguably the most sensitive of all nine tipping points mentioned. [4]
  Coral reefs are, although covering less than 0,1% of the sea ground, one of the most biological complex and valuable ecosystems worldwide, harbouring around a quarter of all marine diversity. [7] Not only animal and plant species highly depend on them (as a source for shelter and food amongst other things) [6], but even around half a billion humans. [1] They are of great economic importance and protect coastal regions from flooding and erosion.[6]
  Most coral reefs exist in shallow water, provided with sufficient sun light and at water temperatures between 18°C and 30°C, meaning that secular heat waves stress them particularly. [1] As heat waves have occurred more frequently in the past 40 years the earth has lost about half of its riffs.[?] Increasing water temperatures cause algae (zooxanthellae), which provide corals with their color and energy through photosynthesis, to become poisonous and get rejected.[?]

  A collapse in the following centuries is very likely with global warming surpassing an average of 1,5°C. [3]
