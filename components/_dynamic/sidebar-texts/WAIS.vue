  # West Antarctic Ice Sheet Loss
  Even though the West Antarctic Ice Sheet isn’t the biggest Antarctic region it could, if completely melted, raise global sea levels by around 3,3 meters and thereby alter global coastlines substantially. The threshold of this tipping point is suspected to lie between 1,5°C and 2°C regional warming.

  Warmer temperatures are the major source for ice sheet loss, especially wind and ocean heat as great parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lie beneath sea level. Grounded ice sheet bases thin and melt underwater on account of the warm ocean while warm winds increase ablation and surface melting, ultimately developing ice shelves that float toward the coast.

  This so called Marine Ice Sheet Instability is a self-sustaining event where the grounding line (meaning the boundary line underneath the glacier where the grounded ice sheet becomes a floating ice shelf) recedes, lifting more ice off the seafloor and turning it into floating ice shelves. This allows the ice to flow faster, which causes more thinning and lastly more lifted ice. Usually the lost ice gets replaced by fresh snowfall but as increasing temperatures cause less snowfall and accelerate the ice loss process, it results in rising sea levels.

  In Antarctica the Amundsen sea sector glaciers contribute the most to global sea levels. And although ice loss will take centuries to complete, it is suspected that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet currently is in the early stages of marine ice sheet instability and it’s proven that in the last quarter century the ice loss rate has tripled.
