  # West African Monsoon Shift

  A monsoon is defined by a reversal of winds and moves with the position of the sun. While West Africa experiences dry winds coming from the inland from November to May, around June to September northward winds bring rainfall originating from the North Atlantic. This seasonal phenomenon has shown severe impact on the Sahel climate, which is a semi-arid region between the northern Sahara desert and southern tropical forest, stretching from east to west on the African continent.

  While the 1950s and 60s stood out due to their wet conditions, the 1970s and 80s were defined by droughts and consequential famines. This demonstrated the exceptional sensitivity of the Monsoon, that is mostly contingent on sea surface temperatures. For example “warming over the tropics leads to drought over the Sahel, whereas warming over the North Atlantic promotes increased rainfall.”

  As ocean temperatures increase the temperature contrast in the summer between the hot land surface and cooler waters reduces and causes the monsoon to shift southward and provoke more droughts. It has been suggested that anthropogenic factors like greenhouse gas emissions and sulfate aerosols are partly at fault. Rising global temperatures are responsible for faster moisture evaporation off the land and therefore decreasing local rainfalls, which again leads to less vegetation growth, lastly stimulating the desertification process.

  Global warming of 1,5 °C entails more severe droughts and declining crop yields but “[u]nder global warming of more than 2°C, the western Sahel might experience the strongest drying and experience serious food security issues.”
