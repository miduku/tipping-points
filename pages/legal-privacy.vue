    <h3>Adobe Fonts</h3>
    <p>
      This website uses so-called Web fonts, which are provided through the
      Adobe Fonts service of Adobe Systems Incorporated, 345 Park Avenue, San
      Jose, 95110-2704 California, USA (»Adobe Fonts«), for consistent
      presentation of fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you visit a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into its
      browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. To do this, the
      browser you are using must connect to the Adobe Fonts servers. This gives
      Adobe Fonts knowledge that this website has been accessed via your IP
      address. If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font will
      be used by your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of Adobe Fonts is in the interest of a uniform and attractive
      presentation of this website. This constitutes a legitimate interest
      within the meaning of §6 par. 1 lit. f GDPR.
